# Brain Machine Pong Game

## 1. React Based Pong Game



## 2. EEG Training Pipeline

a. play pong game while recording EEG (keyboard based) <br>
b. analyse recordings to make an ML based model for mapping EEG activity to keyboard instructions <br>
c. 


## Future Modules
### 1. Neuron Model to make computer play the game and train it with reinforcement learning to play better.
